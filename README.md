# Caffeine & Commerce: Multi-Store Retail Intelligence Dashboard
<br>

## About this project

<p>
<ul>
  <li>Developed an interactive Excel dashboard analyzing sales and transaction trends across Astoria, Hell’s Kitchen, and Lower Manhattan.</li>
  <li>By combining pivot tables with compelling visualizations, I delivered key business insights: </li>
  <ul>
    <li>☕ Coffee reigns supreme in product categories </li>
    <li>📆 Fridays and Mondays lead in weekly transactions </li>
    <li>⏰ 10 AM is peak hour for customer traffic </li>
    <li>📈 Revenue surged steadily from January to June</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<br>
The dashboard enables store managers to optimize inventory, staff scheduling, and promotional timing—powered by real-time, visual data storytelling.
